## Diabetes

### Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes based on various health indicators. The project uses the following tools and libraries:
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **KNeighborsClassifier**: For the initial machine learning model.
- **Cross-validation**: For improving the model's accuracy.

### Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Load the dataset using Pandas.
    - Clean and preprocess the data.
    - Visualize the data using Matplotlib.
  
2. **Model Training**:
    - Train a KNeighborsClassifier model.
    - Achieve an initial accuracy of 0.68.

3. **Model Improvement**:
    - Apply cross-validation to the model.
    - Improve the accuracy to 0.77.




### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dostonshernazarov/Diabetes_models.git
    cd Diabetes_models
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and run the Jupyter notebooks:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
